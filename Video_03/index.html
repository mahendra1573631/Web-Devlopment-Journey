    <h1>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</h1>
    <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of improving a website's visibility in organic (non-paid) search results to increase its quantity and quality of traffic. It involves a variety of methods, including keyword research, on-page content optimization, technical improvements, and building back links, to make a site more discoverable and higher-ranked on search engines like Google. </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Indexing: Search engines like Google crawl the web, store copies of websites in an index, and use complex algorithms to rank them.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Ranking:  SEO is the process of making your website more relevant and authoritative in the eyes of these algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Organic traffic: By improving a site's ranking, SEO aims to drive "organic" traffic, which is free traffic from search results, rather than paid advertising.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Key Components of SEO</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Keyword research: Identifying the words and phrases your target audience is searching for. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>On-page SEO: Optimizing individual web pages, including content, meta tags, and internal links, to make them more understandable for both users and search engines.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Off-page SEO: A broad category that includes building a site's reputation, most notably by earning high-quality back links from other authoritative websites.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Technical SEO:  Improving a website's performance, such as its speed, mobile-friendliness, and craw lability, to ensure search engines can easily index it. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Benefits of SEO</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased visibility: A higher ranking makes a website more visible to potential customers searching for products or services.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>More Traffic:  Improved visibility leads to more organic traffic, which can translate to more leads and customers.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved user experience: SEO practices often lead to a better, more intuitive user experience on the website, which can reduce frustration and improve brand perception.</li>
    </ul>
    


    <h2>Core Wev Vitals</h2>
    <h3>Their are 3 types of Core Web Vitals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Largest Contentful Paint(LCP): Measures loading performance by recording the time it takes for the largest content element (like an image or a hero section) to become visible in the viewport. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Interaction to Next Paint(INP): Measures interactivity by tracking the latency of all user interactions with a page, such as clicks or taps. This metric replaced First Input Delay (FID) in March 2024. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Cumulative Layout Shift(CLS): Measures visual stability by calculating the total amount of unexpected layout shift of all visible page elements during the entire lifespan of the page. </li>
    </ul>
