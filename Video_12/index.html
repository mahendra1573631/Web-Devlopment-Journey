    <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>About Css</h2>
        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of web pages written in HTML or XML. It is a fundamental technology for web development, working alongside HTML (which provides structure and content) and JavaScript (which adds interactivity).</p>
        <h2>Key Aspects of CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Styling and Presentation: CSS controls the visual appearance of web page elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and positioning. It allows web designers to create visually appealing and consistent designs across a website.</li>
            <li>Separation of Concerns: A major advantage of CSS is its ability to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This makes websites easier to maintain, as style changes can be applied globally from a single CSS file without modifying individual HTML pages.</li>
            <li>Cascading Nature: The "Cascading" in CSS refers to how styles are applied and prioritized. When multiple style rules apply to the same element, a specific set of rules determines which style takes precedence, based on factors like specificity, inheritance, and the order of declaration.</li>
            <li>Syntax: CSS consists of rules, each comprising a selector and a declaration block. The selector targets specific HTML elements (e.g., h1, p, or elements with specific classes or IDs). The declaration block contains one or more declarations, each a property-value pair (e.g., color: blue; font-size: 16px;).</li>
            <li>External, Internal, and Inline Styles: CSS can be implemented in several ways:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>External Stylesheets: Stored in separate .css files and linked to HTML documents. This is the most common and recommended method for larger projects.</li>
                    <li>Internal Stylesheets: Placed within &lt;style&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document.</li>
                    <li>Inline Styles: Applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. Generally discouraged for maintainability.</li>
                </ul>
</li>
<li>Benefits:
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Time Efficiency: Write CSS once and apply it to multiple pages.</li>
        <li>Easy Maintenance: Global style changes from a single file.</li>
        <li>Consistency: Ensures a uniform look and feel across a website.</li>
        <li>Improved Accessibility: Better control over presentation for users with different needs.</li>
        <li>Faster Page Loads: By separating styles, CSS files can be cached, reducing load times.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
        </ul>
